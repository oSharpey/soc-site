## It's time for the first official Warwick Cyber Security Society Ball!

Join us at The Orangery, Leamington CV32 4EW for a magical night to remember! From a live DJ to professional photography, we're putting on a ball that is sure to be unforgettable.
The ball includes a 3-course meal, options for this will be released closer to the event. There will be vegan and vegetarian options available, along with options for any other dietary requirements.
The dress code for the evening is formal, so please come dressed to impress! But of course, make sure you can still hit the dance floor...
We would love to see as many of you there as possible - come join us for an amazing way to round off the year, and a celebration of all the hard work of our exec, coursemates and all those involved in making the Society as awesome as it is!
